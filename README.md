# Clicker
Simple Servlet Practice

Uses Apache Tomcat and MySQL

The data is stored locally under db.clicks in localhost:3306

The server his hosted locally under localhost:8080/clicker

The way I have it set up is with the files in the following locations:

tomcat/webapps/clicker/ClickCounter.html

tomcat/webapps/clicker/ClickerCounter.js

tomcat/webapps/clicker/Style.css

tomcat/webapps/clicker/WEB-INF/web.xml

tomcat/webapps/clicker/WEB-INF/classes/ScoreKeeper.class (from ScoreKeeper.java)
